UFQA is a self-supervised dual encoder framework for predicting fingerphoto quality scores aligned with biometric matching performance. The model leverages quality maps for additional supervision, ensuring both global utility and local image quality are accurately captured.

## üìå Abstract
Quality assessment of fingerphotos i.e. fingerprints captured using smartphone or digital cameras, is essential for reliable biometric recognition. UFQA uses a self-supervised dual encoder architecture to fuse features in latent space, predicting a quality metric aligned with utility in matching scenarios. Experiments show UFQA outperforms NFIQ2.2 and other state-of-the-art image quality assessment algorithms on multiple public datasets.
